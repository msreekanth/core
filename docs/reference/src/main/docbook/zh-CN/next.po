msgid "Because CDI is so new, there&#39;s not yet a lot of information available online. That will change over time. Regardless, the CDI specification remains the authority for information on CDI. The spec is less than 100 pages and is quite readable (don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not like your Blu-ray player manual). Of course, it covers many details we&#39;ve skipped over here. The spec is available on the <ulink url=\"http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299\">JSR-299 page</ulink> at the JCP website."

msgid "The CDI reference implementation, Weld, is being developed at the <ulink url=\"http://seamframework.org/Weld\">Seam project</ulink>. The RI development team and the CDI spec lead blog at <ulink url=\"http://in.relation.to\">in.relation.to</ulink>. This guide was originally based on a series of blog entries published there while the specification was being developed. It&#39;s probably the best source of information about the future of CDI, Weld and Seam."

#~ msgid "Of course, the Web Beans specification is the best source of more information about Web Beans. The spec is about 100 pages long, only twice the length of this article, and almost as readable. But, of course, it covers many details that we've skipped over. The spec is available from <literal>http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299</literal>."
#~ msgstr "当然，Web Bean规范是有关Web Bean信息的最佳来源。这个规范大约有100页，只是这个文章的两倍长，并且可读性很好。它覆盖了我们这里跳过的很多细节。这个规范可以从<literal>http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299</literal>下载。"
