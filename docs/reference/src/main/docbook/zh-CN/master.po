msgid "Shortly before the final draft of JSR-299 was submitted, the specification changed its name from &#34;Web Beans&#34; to &#34;Java Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform&#34;, abbreviated CDI. For a brief period after the renaming, the reference implementation adopted the name &#34;Web Beans&#34;. However, this ended up causing more confusion than it solved and Red Hat decided to change the name of the reference implementation to &#34;Weld&#34;. You may still find other documentation, blogs, forum posts, etc. that use the old nomenclature. Please update any references you can. The naming game is over."

msgid "You&#39;ll also find that some of the functionality that once existed in the specification is now missing, such as defining beans in XML. These features will be available as portable extensions for CDI in the Weld project, and perhaps other implementations."

msgid "Note that this reference guide was started while changes were still being made to the specification. We&#39;ve done our best to update it for accuracy. If you discover a conflict between what is written in this guide and the specification, the specification is the authority—assume it is correct. If you believe you have found an error in the specification, please report it to the JSR-299 EG."

#~ msgid "JSR-299 has recently changed its name from \"Web Beans\" to \"Java Contexts and Dependency Injection\". The reference guide still refers to JSR-299 as \"Web Beans\" and the JSR-299 Reference Implementation as the \"Web Beans RI\". Other documentation, blogs, forum posts etc. may use the new nomenclature, including the new name for the JSR-299 Reference Implementation - \"Web Beans\"."
#~ msgstr "JSR-299最近将名字从\"Web Beans\"改为\"Java上下文和依赖注入\"。参考指南仍然使用\"Web Beans\"名称，参考实现仍然使用\"Web Beans RI\"名称。其他的文档，博客，论坛帖子等等可能使用新的命名，包括新的JSR-299参考实现的名字- \"Web Beans\"。"

#~ msgid "You'll also find that some of the more recent functionality to be specified is missing (such as producer fields, realization, asynchronous events, XML mapping of EE resources)."
