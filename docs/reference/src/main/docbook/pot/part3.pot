msgid "These techniques serve to enable loose coupling of client and server. The client is no longer tightly bound to an implementation of an interface, nor is it required to manage the lifecycle of the implementation. This approach lets <emphasis>stateful objects interact as if they were services</emphasis>."

msgid "Loose coupling makes a system more <emphasis>dynamic</emphasis>. The system can respond to change in a well-defined manner. In the past, frameworks that attempted to provide the facilities listed above invariably did it by sacrificing type safety (most notably by using XML descriptors). CDI is the first technology, and certainly the first specification in the Java EE platform, that achieves this level of loose coupling in a typesafe way."

msgid "The second major theme of CDI is <emphasis>strong typing</emphasis>. The information about the dependencies, interceptors and decorators of a bean, and the information about event consumers for an event producer, is contained in typesafe Java constructs that may be validated by the compiler."

msgid "You don&#39;t see string-based identifiers in CDI code, not because the framework is hiding them from you using clever defaulting rules—so-called &#34;configuration by convention&#34;—but because there are simply no strings there to begin with!"

msgid "The obvious benefit of this approach is that <emphasis>any</emphasis> IDE can provide autocompletion, validation and refactoring without the need for special tooling. But there is a second, less-immediately-obvious, benefit. It turns out that when you start thinking of identifying objects, events or interceptors via annotations instead of names, you have an opportunity to lift the semantic level of your code."
