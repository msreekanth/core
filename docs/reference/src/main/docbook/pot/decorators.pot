msgid "Interceptors are a powerful way to capture and separate concerns which are <emphasis>orthogonal</emphasis> to the application (and type system). Any interceptor is able to intercept invocations of any Java type. This makes them perfect for solving technical concerns such as transaction management, security and call logging. However, by nature, interceptors are unaware of the actual semantics of the events they intercept. Thus, interceptors aren&#39;t an appropriate tool for separating business-related concerns."

#. Tag: para

msgid "The reverse is true of <emphasis>decorators</emphasis>. A decorator intercepts invocations only for a certain Java interface, and is therefore aware of all the semantics attached to that interface. Since decorators directly implement operations with business semantics, it makes them the perfect tool for modeling some kinds of business concerns. It also means that a decorator doesn&#39;t have the generality of an interceptor. Decorators aren&#39;t able to solve technical concerns that cut across many disparate types. Interceptors and decorators, though similar in many ways, are complementary. Let&#39;s look at some cases where decorators fit the bill."
